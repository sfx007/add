The white stone of the local quarries lined the walls, buildings, and streets, and magic practically burst from every inch of it. Flying carpets dotted the skies, and enchanted constructs went about their errands at the behest of their wizardly owners. Architecture melded with botany on every corner, making the city feel alive in a way that felt natural. ",-1),e("p",null,' Unfortunately, Ballan and his friends did not arrive in the Holy City on a street. No, they arrived outside the walls, on a dingy ferry, on a muddy stretch of land known locally as "The Dredge". The city was situated on an island surrounded by the sizable Barrier Lake, and unless one wanted to trek north through the main gate - something that could take weeks - it was by ferry you arrived at the Holy City, or not at all. ',-1),e("p",null,` Well, or flying carpet. Boots had wanted to take the boat "for novelty's sake", and so it was they found themselves stepping off the ferry and surveying The Dredge dubiously. Most of the people seemed keen to get their feet out of the mud, either by leaving expeditiously or by getting on a watercraft of their own. A pair of surly guards with (relatively) clean armor bore the tabard of the Wardsworn, but paid them no particular attention - thankfully. Even so, Ballan saw Tilda put her hood up. `,-1),e("p",null,`"Let's beat it." Tilda murmured, leading them away from the dock.`,-1),e("p",null," Word either had not spread of what had happened at The Wall, or it had been drowned out in the bustle of the city. Either way, they had not seen anything to indicate that they were wanted individuals, so for the time being, their crimes had gone unnoticed. However, if word got out that a Sauronid prisoner had escaped, Ballan wasn't sure how low of a profile they'd be able to keep. Sauronid originated somewhere within the Wilds, and so there simply were not very many of them around. ",-1),e("p",null,"His stoic refusal to hide his face didn't help.",-1),e("p",null,' "Too long was I cut off from the sun in that stone cell." Krakkus crowed, spreading his arms wide in the sunlight. Several passersby gave him odd looks and Tilda hissed at him to be quiet, but he just gave her a toothy grin. "My small deceitful friend, look!" Krakkus pointed up at the sky, causing Tilda to squint upwards dramatically with a sour expression. "Truly there is no greater power in all the heavens. It lavishes us with warmth and light, all of us made equal beneath its beneficence!" ',-1),e("p",null,` "Shut up about beneficence." Tilda groaned. "The Wardsworn don't like other people hawking their religions in Avony - so keep it to yourself." `,-1),e("p",null,` "It's not a religion, Tilda." Krakkus reminded her - and it did seem as though they had this particular argument quite a few times, albeit not in the presence of others. While Holgith seemed distracted taking in the sights, Kayha had been listening with careful attention. `,-1),e("p",null,' "Who are the Wardsworn?" She asked Ballan, not even looking at Tilda. Still frosty with her, he supposed. Not that Tilda was easy to get along with on the best of days... ',-1),e("p",null,' "They primarily act as the city guard." Ballan explained. "But they are officially the military arm of the Church of Avonia, and act with the authority of the Archbishop. As Tilda mentioned, the church believes Avonia to be the only true God, so..." He shrugged. ',-1),e("p",null,'"Holgith thought Zagaroth was also God." The large orc pointed out.',-1),e("p",null,` "It's largely semantics." Ballan hurried to explain. "While there's been plenty of proof of both Avonia's and Zagaroth's existence, the longstanding debate has been whether they qualify as deities at all." `,-1),e("p",null,' "...Something difficult, if not impossible, to prove." Kayha murmured thoughtfully. Ballan was reminded that, until a few weeks ago, she had believed Pythagoras to be a deity herself. ',-1),e("p",null,` "Listen, if you folks want to blaspheme that's on you - let's just make sure no one can overhear us." Tilda complained as she led them towards the southern gate. A crowd had gathered in an unorderly queue outside the gate, and were being steadily let in by a small group of guards. A checkpoint was typical to gain access to the city, but by the size of the line they would be waiting for a while. `,-1),e("p",null,` "You didn't strike me as the religious sort, Tilda." Kahya commented, purposefully casual. `,-1),e("p",null,` "You didn't strike me as the nosy sort." Tilda replied shortly. Kahya opened her mouth to respond, but Ballan caught her eye and shook his head. He mouthed the phrase "touchy subject", and Kahya just furrowed her brow. She did not press further, however. `,-1),e("p",null," As they waited for the line to move forward, Ballan looked up at the looming city walls. The world was a chaotic place outside of the Wards, it was true. The Church of Avonia claimed that the Wards were originally erected by the Goddess herself to shield the people of this land from the chaos of the Wilds. And, while the Wards themselves have long been the subject of intense study, no living wizard - or group of wizards - had ever been able to recreate their construction. ",-1),e("p",null," Ballan wasn't exactly sure that was proof of anything, but many people disagreed. ",-1),e("p",null,` "Once we're inside the city, we'll mosey on over to my tower for a spot of lunch!" Boots announced suddenly, coinciding with a rumbling in his large stomach. "While I may be Ursa-Non-Grata with the Archmage's council, I've been given leave to make use of my usual quarters. Very convenient, as most of my favorite things are there!" `,-1),e("p",null,`"It's a nice place." Tilda commented, off-hand.`,-1),e("p",null,` "I keep forgetting you've been." Boots replied drily, causing Tilda to give him a sheepish look. Ballan was going to add something, but a commotion at the front of the queue got his attention. The Wardsworn were speaking with someone, and Ballan watched as they pointed back at their small group. `,-1),e("p",null,`"...Looks like trouble." Ballan murmured, tugging on Boots' cloak.`,-1),e("p",null,` "They've already seen us." Tilda agreed, voice low. "Nothing to do but see how this shakes out." `,-1),e("p",null,' "Why are you whispering?" Holgith asked loudly. Ballan slapped his palm into his face, and sighed heavily. Meanwhile, the Wardsworn were making their way over. The crowd parted before them. ',-1),e("p",null,' "You there!" One of them shouted, pointing at Boots. Boots, comically, pointed at himself. Ballan briefly considered making a break for it, and could tell Tilda was of the same mind. Given that they were on an island, however, there was not really anywhere else they could go. ',-1),e("p",null,' "How can I help you, my good sirs and madames?" Boots asked the small group of guards - four in total - as they finally came close enough for conversation. ',-1),e("p",null,' "Are you the Archmage..." One of the guards pulled out a sheaf of parchment, and unfolded it. "...Boots?" ',-1),e("p",null,' "Former Archmage, but yes, I am indeed he!" Boots declared, puffing out his chest. The Wardsworn shared a look with each other, and then their ringleader addressed Ballan and the others. ',-1),e("p",null,' "We have it on good authority that you and yours averted a crisis in Reubenberg this past fortnight." The guard explained. "The Archbishop has asked to meet with you personally regarding these events, as his personal guests." ',-1),e("p",null,"The four Wardsworn saluted, and then bowed.",-1),e("p",null," Ballan's eyebrows had risen higher and higher on his forehead as the guard spoke, and they had no intention of lowering anytime soon. ",-1),e("p",null,' "How... unexpected?" Ballan managed. The guard gave him something like a comforting smile. ',-1),e("p",null,` "The missive didn't mention these two." One of the other guards pointed out, gesturing to Krakkus and Tilda. `,-1),e("p",null,` "We, uh, couldn't possibly go anywhere without our stalwart companions." Ballan interjected hastily, trying to sound more confident than he felt. Luckily, the Wardsworn in charge simply shrugged. `,-1),e("p",null,' "All are welcome in the presence of the Archbishop." He declared, before stepping to one side. "If you could follow me..." ',-1),e("p",null," Ballan glanced around at everyone else. It seemed they had no other choice, and so, they followed. ",-1),e("p",null,` "It's a good thing you were able to make it to the city safely." The affable guard in charge commented. "We've gotten a report that the pirate you all apprehended in Reubenberg escaped from prison." Ballan and Kahya exchanged a glance. So, nothing else about the prison break had been reported...? "The hunt is ongoing, but he wouldn't dare show his face in the city." The guard gestured them all forward as they reached the gate. He gave them a wide, sincere smile. "You'll be safe here." `,-1),e("p",null," Somehow, stepping across the threshold of the most secure city in the World, Ballan didn't feel any safer at all. ",-1),e("hr",null,null,-1),e("p",null," A carriage was waiting for them beyond the city gates, so they did not have to walk the entire way to the Avonian cathedral, which was located near the center of the city. Ballan's knee still ached something fierce, so he was grateful for the reprieve from the road. Still, the strangeness of the situation unsettled him. Hopefully it really was as benign as it all seemed... ",-1),e("p",null,' "There are so many people..." Kahya mentioned, awestruck, from the window seat. This would be her first time in the city. Ballan had only just forgotten how noisy it could be. "How would you find anyone in a place like this?" ',-1),e("p",null,` "You find people by knowing people." Tilda explained, disgruntled. She was sandwiched in between Boots and Krakkus on the opposite bench. She was the only one that would fit. "Information's my stock and trade here, and I know exactly who we need to talk to so we can track down Trav." She glanced around at the carriage. "After, uh, our meeting with his Holiness." `,-1),e("p",null,' "What do you think he wants with us, anyway?" Ballan asked. Boots shrugged. ',-1),e("p",null,` "The Archbishop is a fair-minded and generous man. I expect he wishes to congratulate us on saving Ruebenberg." Boots explained. "I've never had the pleasure of conversing with him personally, but that's what I hear." `,-1),e("p",null,'"One good turn deserves another." Krakkus agreed.',-1),e("p",null,'"We can hope..." Ballan muttered as they approached the cathedral.',-1),e("p",null," While many of the buildings in Avony were large, the cathedral soared above the others, its four belltowers, each taller than the last, rising in a circle around it. The gardens surrounding the cathedral were immaculately tended, with flowers of all colors in full bloom. Massive trees, clearly cultivated over decades, provided shade over various walking paths, and marble fountains burbled alongside them. A monument to order, stability, and peace - or so it was told. ",-1),e("p",null," Ballan had to admit, the entire place seemed perfectly idyllic. He hoped it would stay that way as the carriage rolled to a halt in front of the steps leading up to the building. ",-1),e("p",null,` "I forgot to ask..." Boots mentioned to the leading guard as they stepped out of the carriage. "Will luncheon be served? We've been on the road all morning you see..." `,-1),e("p",null,' "For esteemed guests such as yourselves, a repast can certainly be arranged!" Boomed a voice from the top of the steps, almost causing Ballan to flinch. A large, round man with dark skin and white hair stood atop the steps, his arms stretched wide. He had a full, thick beard and wore probably the strangest hat Ballan had ever seen - and he spent most of his time with Boots. He was bedecked in white robes, and used a crozier to steady himself as he descended the marble steps. ',-1),e("p",null," Notably, he wore a golden medallion prominently around his neck. Ballan had not heard that the Archbishop was Destined. ",-1),e("p",null,` "Friends - no, heroes!" The Archbishop continued, beaming at all of them. The Wardsworn fanned out around them, saluting and bowing to him. He bid them take their ease with only a wave of his hand. "It is my pleasure to welcome you with honor to the Cathedral of Avonia. Now - Gerrard, if you could speak with the staff about lunch..." He directed this quest at the guard who had come to fetch them, and he immediately left to do as he was told. "The rest of you, please, follow me. Introductions can wait until you've rested from the road." `,-1),e("p",null," Ballan glanced at his companions. Holgith and Krakkus seemed at ease, and even Kahya was pleasantly surprised. Boots just looked hungry, but it was Tilda who seemed the most out of place. She seemed... nervous. Distinctly un-Tildalike. It was almost refreshing to see her squirm for once, but Ballan couldn't bring himself even that small amount of satisfaction. He didn't have it in him. ",-1),e("p",null," As they stepped into the building, Ballan was amazed to find it felt little different from the outside. Trees, grasses, and flowers lined the inside of the building as well, with magical lamps providing sunlight where the large, arched windows could not reach. Servitor constructs wordlessly moved about the cathedral, tending to the inner gardens that existed between the pews. Despite the glade-like surroundings, there was truly a massive amount of seating in the central chamber. Most impressive, however, was the pulpit in the very front. It had been carved - or perhaps grown - out of a massive oak tree. ",-1),e("p",null,` "We are fortunate indeed to have been blessed here with such beauty by Avonia herself." The Archbishop commented, gesturing to the plantlife. "Though the Cathedral itself makes for a poor place to host guests, so we'll have lunch in the inner courtyard." `,-1),e("p",null,' "Avonia put these here?" Kahya asked blithely, and Ballan saw Tilda shoot the monk a worried look. The Archbishop only chuckled. ',-1),e("p",null,' "All things of beauty were gifted to us by Avonia." He clarified. "As are all things of peace, and love. She has created for us an orderly haven within the Wards, and we are dutybound to ensure that her realm remains peaceable and secure." He nodded to the Wardsworn still accompanying them. "These fine men and women have dedicated their lives to ensuring it is so." ',-1),e("p",null,' "Avonia made all pretty things?" Holgith asked loudly. "Good to know. Holgith must thank her later for butterflies and mother." ',-1),e("p",null," The Archbishop let out a boisterous belly laugh, and even one of the guards snickered. Finally, Ballan felt the tension leave his shoulders. Maybe this was just going to be a good thing. ",-1),e("p",null," The courtyard was designed concentrically, with a small circular gazebo in the center, under which a table had been placed. Already, monks had begun laying out a surprisingly common luncheon. Simple breads and cheeses, pitchers of ice-cold cordial, and several slabs of preserved fish, which Boots was already eyeing hungrily. The Archbishop bid them all to take their seats, though the Wardsworn took up positions of sentry around the gazebo. ",-1),e("p",null," Once everyone was seated, Holgith began eating immediately, which earned him an aghast look from Tilda. The Archbishop, however, simply bowed his head and murmured a short prayer thanking Avonia for the food. He then bade everyone dig in, even if Holgith was already eating. ",-1),e("p",null,' "Now, I understand this must have come as something of a shock." The Archbishop began, folding his hands over his stomach and leaning the crozier against the table. "But when I had received the news Reubenberg had been spared a terrible fate - that perhaps you had even protected the Wards from that looming monstrosity - I simply could not let such gallantry go unrewarded." He nodded solemnly. "But first - As you doubtlessly know, I am Archbishop Leovold Dominus IV, though my given name is Randall. You have leave to refer to me as such in private company." He looked at the rest of them expectantly. Boots presently had a mouthful of fish, and he "nudged" Ballan with his elbow, nearly knocking him over. ',-1),e("p",null,` "Oh, I'm uh... Ballan. Ballan Agrandian." He gave a small bow. Was it awkward? He didn't know. Boots nudged him again, and gestured to everyone. "...And this is Boots, current ex-Archmage." Ballan said, before indicating Kahya. "This is Kahya, of the... Nuit tribe." Kahya nodded once. "This is Tilda Barrowbushel, and Krakkus of the Sauronid." Tilda mumbled something that sounded strangely like "your worshipfulness", and Krakkus slammed his fist into his chest - some sort of salute. "And lastly we have Holgith." `,-1),e("p",null,' "Ib goob cheeshe." Holgith commented, pointing at a half-eaten block of gouda, mouth full. Despite the strange introductions, the Archbishop - or Randall? - seemed simply pleased as punch to meet them all. Boots had the right idea about the man after all, or so it appeared. ',-1),e("p",null,' "Well, Ballan Agrandian, Boots, Tilda Barrowbushel, Krakkus of the Sauronid, and Holgith..." The Archbishop began solemnly. "In light of your service to the realm, and your protection of the Wards, I present each of you with a gift befitting such acts of heroism." He clapped his hands, and several monks appeared carrying objects. "Ballan, for you - a gold lined spellbook, complete with self-writing quill and warded against magical intrusion. May the spells you inscribe upon its pages continue to serve Avony." ',-1),e("p",null," One of the monks stepped forward, handing Ballan probably the fanciest book he'd ever seen in his life. And a real spellbook at that! He'd given up on ever actually owning one. They were devilishly expensive, difficult to maintain, and almost impossible to create for hedge mages like himself. Gingerly, he opened it. Every page, blank. It was perfect. ",-1),e("p",null,"He was speechless.",-1),e("p",null,` "Kahya of the Nuit - The tragedy of your people weighs heavily still on this old man's conscience." As the Archbishop spoke sadly, another monk stepped forward. On a velvet pillow lay a small, wooden totem, depicting a horned whale of some sort. "This gift was given to the previous Archbishop by your people. I return it now to you." Gently, Kahya lifted the totem. `,-1),e("p",null,' "Qilalugaq..." She whispered, then held the totem to her chest, and closed her eyes. ',-1),e("p",null,` "Holgith, though your people lived outside the protection of the Wards, still you came to their defense." The Archbishop's glowing commendation was tinged with sadness. "And yet I sense the touch of great darkness upon you. A curse of pain, placed upon you by the enemy. If you are so willing, I will cleanse it for you." `,-1),e("p",null,"Holgith stared at the Archbishop thoughtfully for a moment.",-1),e("p",null,'"Will Holgith keep scars?" He asked. "Holgith wants scars."',-1),e("p",null,' "Sadly, the scars are beyond my ability to heal." The Archbishop confirmed. "But I can remove the curse, so it hurts no longer." ',-1),e("p",null,' "Holgith accepts!" He shouted, and then lifted and downed an entire pitcher of cordial in one go. The Archbishop nodded, and bade one of the monks to prepare a cleansing ritual for the orc. Lastly, he turned to Krakkus and Tilda. ',-1),e("p",null,' "As for the two of you - though you may have not had a hand in the events that took place in Ruebenberg, your choice of companions speaks well of your character." Another monk stepped forward, placing a small rosary in front of Tilda, and a golden emblem in front of Krakkus. "Simple gifts of jewellery from the Holy Vaults, may their beauty remind you of the wonderful friends you already have." ',-1),e("p",null," Tilda just sort of stared at the rosary without touching it, but Krakkus immediately found somewhere to pin the emblem, grinning. ",-1),e("p",null,' "Gold! You are too kind, Randall." Krakkus complimented, enchanted by his new bauble. ',-1),e("p",null,' "Yes, thank you." Ballan finally said, having regained his voice. Scarcely a month ago he had been a washed-up hedge mage with no prospects. Now, he was being thanked personally by one of the most powerful people in Avony. Such a reversal of fortune he could scarcely believe. The Archbishop clapped his hands together. ',-1),e("p",null,` "It is a small thing to bestow such gifts upon defenders of the realm!" He crowed. "Now lastly, Boots - While I'm sad we've never crossed paths before now, I am nevertheless aware of the conundrum you now face. I am happy to report that the Wardsworn recently recovered one of your missing Arcanum crystals... which I bestow now upon you." `,-1),e("p",null," Boots seemed shocked - he even stopped eating for a moment - and leaned forward as a monk opened a reliquary, revealing a purple arcanum crystal within. As soon as the box opened, Ballan could feel the potent concentration of mana wash over him like a crackling wave. ",-1),e("p",null,' "My, my! This is good fortune indeed!" Boots took the Arcanum crystal gingerly, before squirreling it away in his robes. "The Church has always been good to the Archmage council, Archbishop. You have my thanks." ',-1),e("p",null,' "Think nothing of it!" The Archbishop replied. "Would that we had more information on your crystal thief. Alas, our investigation is still ongoing." Ballan did his best not to glance at Tilda. ',-1),e("p",null,' "Oh?" Boots cocked his head. "The Church has an interest in finding this person?" ',-1),e("p",null,' "Actually, I do." A dry voice announced from behind them, and everyone turned to look. Standing in the garden was a tall, severe man with angular features and perfectly oiled, black hair. He seemed to regard everything with the cool air of disinterest common among nobility, though his eyes were ringed with dark circles as though he never got enough sleep. He carried a short cane in one hand, though it never touched the ground, and otherwise wore a nondescript but clearly fine black and gold coat. "I have it on good authority that the individual I am seeking and your crystal thief are one and the same." ',-1),e("p",null,` "Lord Malcom! This is a surprise." The Archbishop declared. Malcolm...? Where had Ballan heard that name before. He glanced at Tilda, who had gone white as a sheet, and Krakkus, who also seemed... perturbed. Right... They had mentioned Malcom's men had apprehended them. For his part, the nobleman didn't even glance in their direction, instead focusing his attention on the Archbishop. `,-1),e("p",null,' "Yes, I had come to see if you had learned anything new." He clicked his tongue. "Evidently not. My apologies for interrupting your... lunch." ',-1),e("p",null,' "You are more than welcome to join us if you have a hunger." The Archbishop offered happily. "Lord Malcom is a patron of the Church, you see. His family have long been devoted worshippers of Avonia." ',-1),e("p",null,' "May she bless us with beauty, eternal." Malcolm said with a thin smile. Ballan felt a shiver run down his spine. "This matter can wait, Archbishop. We can discuss our manhunt further in your office." Without another word, Lord Malcom turned on his heel, and vanished deeper into the cathedral. The Archbishop sighed, and took a drink from his cup. ',-1),e("p",null,` "Ah, duty ever calls." He murmured. "Holgith, we've arranged for you to stay the evening if you're feeling poorly following the cleansing ritual. As for the rest of you, I'm assuming you have lodgings arranged...?" `,-1),e("p",null,` "They'll be staying with me, at my tower." Boots informed him. "There's plenty of rooms for everyone!" `,-1),e("p",null,`"Don't you mean room?" Ballan asked.`,-1),e("p",null,'"No." Boots replied.',-1),e("p",null,"The Archbishop clapped his hands together.",-1),e("p",null,` "Well! Feel free to enjoy this lunch until your stomach's content - I must be going. Thank you all again." He stood, gave a small bow, and exited the courtyard with the rest of the Wardsworn. Ballan watched him go with a small frown. Lord Malcom and the Archbishop... `,-1),e("p",null,"That was not the last he was going to see of them. He was sure of it.",-1)])]),_:1})}}}),j=m(y,[["__scopeId","data-v-311f6709"]]);export{j as default};
