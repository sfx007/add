Tilda guided them as best she could, but admitted she was not used to seeing the forest from above. They were able to locate the clearing with Auntie Nub's cottage on it eventually... mostly because it was a pond, and her cottage appeared to be some sort of boat. ",-1),e("p",null," They landed the carpet some distance from the shore, and Ballan wondered why Tilda didn't have them touch down directly on the boat. It all made sense as two eyes surfaced from beneath the pond, and then a snout. There laid an oversized crocodile, staring right at them. Ballan froze, but Tilda just stepped forward. ",-1),e("p",null,` "Oy, Brutus!" She raised her hand at the reptile, which grunted once. "Go tell Auntie that Tilda's here on a medical call!" `,-1),e("p",null,"Without a sound, the crocodile vanished into the pond.",-1),e("p",null,` "That's Brutus, Auntie Nub's familiar."

"We would be wise to respect one so in tune with the natural world." ',-1),e("p",null,` "Tilda!" A voice shrieked from inside the cottage-boat, which began to rock unsteadily. "You half-drowned rat!" The door to the cottage burst open, and out stepped a rotund phobban woman. She was missing her left arm at the elbow, and had a peg-leg beneath the knee on the same side. What's more, her large eyes, which would ordinarily be a solid black color, were instead milky-white with blindness. Her broad, flat salamander-like head swiveled back and forth as she sniffed the air. Then, she flopped into the water, her large, powerful tail bringing her to the shoreline in mere moments. It was then that Ballan realized the woman was nearly six and a half feet tall. `,-1),e("p",null,` "Auntie, I can't believe you're not dead." Tilda replied affectionately. Auntie Nub chuckled. `,-1),e("p",null,` "Well, you're in good health." She sniffed the air some more, passing over Kahya, pausing on Ballan, before finally taking a big whiff of Holgith. "Oh my! Mortrunk, my poor dear... is this what has become of you?" She placed a slimy hand on Holgith's chest, and sighed. "This orc is lost in Mortrunk's memories. They span thousands of years - he may never wake." `,-1),e("p",null,' "What?!?" Ballan had no idea it was so serious. "Is there anything we can do?" Ballan insisted. Auntie Nub cackled, and turned to regard him. ',-1),e("p",null,[a(` "I like that! 'We'! Not "Oh, Auntie Nub, what can `),e("em",null,"you"),a(' do?" She cackled again. "You are a fine young man. And yes! There is something '),e("em",null,"we"),a(` can do!" She gestured at the boat with her good hand. "I'll take our patient aboard and prepare the ritual to bring him home. However, I will need a pure, natural mineral. A pearl - and a large one." `)],-1),e("p",null,'"Where may we find one?" Kahya asked.',-1),e("p",null,` "You're in luck!" Auntie Nub said. "Both good and bad luck, actually. I had such a pearl, but it was pilfered by the Lord of the Mire on account of he's a bastard." Auntie Nub nodded. "Go fetch my pearl from him, and we'll bring your friend home!" She slapped her tail against the ground, and Brutus emerged from the pond once again, this time crawling onto the shore. "Brutus will lead you to him. Good luck! You may need it." `,-1),e("p",null," Without another word, she sat on the flying carpet, smacked it a few times, and it reluctantly raised into the air to spirit Holgith over to her floating cottage. Brutus hissed expectantly, gesturing they should hop on his back. ",-1),e("p",null,` "A crocodile ride." Ballan muttered as he tried to get comfortable on the reptile's back. "...How novel." Kahya crossed her legs, and Tilda made herself comfortable on Brutus' head. Then, the creature began lumbering through the woods. It must have been 10 times Boot's size. Ballan hoped this "Lord of the Mire" would be, at least, amenable to negotiation. `,-1),e("hr",null,null,-1),e("p",null," The Lord of the Mire was a massive crustacean with a shell of iron. Its long time spent in the swamp had turned it a horrifying reddish brown, and the lagoon it currently sequestered in was dyed blood red from the rust. As they entered the clearing, Ballan wasn't given the chance to start an overture of peace before the deeply territorial creature burst forth in attack. Kahya and Tilda leapt off of Brutus' back immediately, while the crocodile retreated to safety. ",-1),e("p",null," The crab was enormous, and fought like it was. Its pincers just missed Ballan as he leapt behind a tree. The tree wasn't so lucky, its one meter diameter crushed instantly in the crab's meaty claws as the old oak split in two. Kahya didn't attempt to attack the thing, she simply analyzed it, looking for a weak point. Several times, the Lord's enormous claws came close to snatching her, but she danced about, keeping her distance. ",-1),e("p",null,`"We've got to disable those claws!" Ballan shouted.`,-1),e("p",null,[a(` "Easy for you to say!" Tilda shouted back. He wasn't sure `),e("em",null,"when"),a(" she had run up a tree, but she was there now.

He made sure he had plenty of slack, otherwise, this was not going to work. Each turn of the rope drooped over his arm and hung down to the forest floor, creating a spool two-meters in diameter. ',-1),e("p",null," The crab was still focused on Kahya, its claws berating the nearby flora in a maddening attempt to slice her in two. There was not much time. He stepped off the crocodile, grabbed his cane, and handed the rope to Brutus with... some hesitation. ",-1),e("p",null,' "Er... could you kindly pull this as taut as you can when I give the signal?" Ballan asked. Brutus, the amenable sort, snorted in agreement. It was probably an agreement anyway. ',-1),e("p",null," Ballan nodded, then muttered an invisibility spell, careful to enchant both himself and the rope. Brutus seemed unperturbed by his disappearing act. Ballan supposed living with a bog Witch would inure even the most skittish of wildlife to magic. ",-1),e("p",null," Ballan carefully - painfully - made his way forward - a direction he never thought he'd be going, what with the flurry of orangeish brown claws whipping around in front of him. Kahya glanced briefly in his direction as she continued to dance and taunt the crab. Doubtlessly, she knew what he was up to. No one was as observant as she. ",-1),e("p",null," A pincer lodged itself in the ground where Kahya had stood moments before, and the Lord let out a frustrated hiss to realize she was now standing on top of his claw. That was easily a ten-foot vertical jump on Kahya's part, but it was obvious she was starting to tire. As the Lord of the Mire ripped the claw back out of the ground, it launched Kahya into the air, and she used the momentum to fly over the top of it, and landed squarely on the creature's back. She slipped for a moment, but then made a pained expression as her foot slipped into the grooves of his shell. ",-1),e("p",null," Reduced to no more than a common beast of burden, the Lord of the Mire roared in rage. His claws, large as they were, could not find purchase on the nimble monk.

",-1),e("p",null,"Kahya, meanwhile, pulled fruitlessly at her stuck foot.",-1),e("p",null," With his leg useless, he would need to rely on magic to get to her in time.

He was not so accomplished a mage that he could improvise a small flight spell and concurrently maintain invisibility. ",-1),e("p",null," Sure, he was directly in front of the Lord of the Mire, on the ground, covered in mud, with a bum leg... but he had a good shot at Kahya's foot.
